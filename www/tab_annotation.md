### Welcome to Annotation module! 
Manual drug annotation is sometimes a time-consuming jobs. In this module, We provide a primary drug annotation curated from the efficacy data of anti-cancer drugs within the **Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database (GSDC)**.  
It includes **IC50 values** for **286 drugs** interacting with **30 cancer cell lines**.  
In instances where multiple drug-cancer pairings are present, we have opted for the smallest IC50 value.  
We categorize **an IC50 value of less than 10Î¼M as 'effective', and conversely, as 'ineffective'**.  
Within the Benchmark module, different methodologies (for ES or for AUC) necessitate varying formats of annotation files, hence it is crucial to select the appropriate mode prior to downloading.
