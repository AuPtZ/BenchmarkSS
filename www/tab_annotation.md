### Welcome to Annotation module! 
Manual drug annotation is sometimes a time-consuming jobs. This module has been designed to streamline and expedite the drug annotation process, significantly reducing manual labor for our users. 
We provide a primary drug annotation based on the extensive and reliable efficacy data from the GSDC (Global Screening Data Center) database.   
The annotation is curated from the efficacy data of anti-cancer drugs within the **GSDC database**.  
It includes **IC50 values** for **286 drugs** interacting with **30 cancer cell lines**.  
In instances where multiple drug-cancer pairings are present, we have opted for the smallest IC50 value.  
We categorize **an IC50 value of less than 10Î¼M as 'effective', and conversely, as 'ineffective'**.  
Within the Benchmark module, different methodologies necessitate varying formats of annotation files, hence it is crucial to select the appropriate mode prior to downloading.
