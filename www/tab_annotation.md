### Welcome to Annotation module! 
Manual drug annotation is sometimes a time-consuming job. In this module, We provide a curated primary drug annotation from the efficacy data of anti-cancer drugs within the **Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database**.  
It includes **IC50 values** for **286 drugs** interacting with **30 cancer cell lines**.  
In instances where multiple drug-cancer pairings are present, we have opted for the smallest IC50 value.  
We categorize **an IC50 value of less than 10μM as 'effective', and conversely, as 'ineffective'**.   
We categorize IC50 values of **less than 10μM as 'effective'**, and those **above as 'ineffective'**.
Within the Benchmark module, different methodologies (for ES or for AUC) necessitate varying formats of annotation files, hence it is crucial to select the appropriate format prior to downloading.
