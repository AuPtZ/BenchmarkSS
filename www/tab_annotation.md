### Welcome to Annotation module! 
This module primarily offers an initial drug annotation.   
The annotation is sourced from the efficacy data of anti-cancer drugs within the **GSDC database**.  
It includes **IC50 values** for **286 drugs** interacting with **30 cancer cell lines**.  
In instances where multiple drug-cancer pairings are present, we have opted for the smallest IC50 value.  
We categorize **an IC50 value of less than 10Î¼M as 'effective', and conversely, as 'ineffective'**.  
Within the Benchmark module, different methodologies necessitate varying formats of annotation files, hence it is crucial to select the appropriate mode prior to downloading.
