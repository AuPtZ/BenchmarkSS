### Welcome to Converter Page (for Gene)  

SSP accepts a two-column signature with **Gene** and **log2FC**. **the identifier of a gene is the gene symbol**. However, as there are other types of gene identifier(Such **ENTREZID** and **ENSEMBL**), The Converter page (for genes) is introduced to provide an easy way to convert signature to compatible format.  
On this page, you can upload your signature and view the results immediately.  


Here are some tips:
1. The Converter accepts signature files with no more than 1000 rows.    
2. Only human **(Homo sapiens)** genes can be converted.   

In addition, we also provide a drug name converter; you can access the sub-module by clicking on the different tabs.
