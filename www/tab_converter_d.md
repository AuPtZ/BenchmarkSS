### Welcome to Converter Page  

SSP accepts annotation head with **drug name**, so **the identifier of drug is drug name**. However, as there are other type of drug identifier(Such **PubChem Cid** and **InChIKeys** ), Converter page is introduced to provide a easy way to convert drug to compatible format.   
In this page, you can upload your drug list, and display immediately.  


Here are some tips:  
1. Converter accepts signature file **no more than 1000 rows**.  
2. When you select "drug name", SSP will attempt to correct drug names **(regarding capitalization or the presence of spaces)** to ensure consistency with the names in inner-built pharmacotranscriptomic datasets.
