### Q&A collection from reviewers
#### 1. How the disease signatures were determined ?
In SSP, disease signature is defined as a gene list with log2FC, which is derived from gene expression profile from cell lines or patients of a specific disease. 
We recommend utilizing sequencing data from patient cohorts, such as **ICGC/TCGA**, or from cell lines, and employing differential expression analysis to obtain the signature (with log2FC).
