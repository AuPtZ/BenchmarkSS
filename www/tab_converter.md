### Welcome to Converter Page

SSP accepts a two-column signature with **Gene** and **log2FC**. **the identifier of Gene is Gene Symbol**. However, as there are other type of gene identifier(Such **ENTREZID** and **ENSEMBL** ), Converter page is introduced to provide a easy way to convert signature to compatible format. 
In this page, you can upload your signature, and display immediately.


Here are some tips:
1. Converter accepts signature file **no more than 1000 rows and header**.
2. Only **human(Homo sapiens)** gene can be converted.
