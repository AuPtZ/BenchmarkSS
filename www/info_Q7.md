### How to annotate drugs?
The principle of annotation is related to the disease you are studying. For example, if you are interesting in liver cancer, you may need download blank annotation of **LINCS_A375/A549_10μM/5μM_24h/12h/6h** to collect annotation on whether a drug is effective against liver cancer. These annotations can generally be obtained based on clinical trials(experimental / approved / failed) or cell experiments (IC50 < 10 μM).   
Clinical trials info can be found on [DrugBank](https://go.drugbank.com/) or [Clinical Trials](https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/). The IC50 of drugs could be found on [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) or [chembl](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/). Also, also we provide annotation module for an primary drug annotation.  
We highly recommend accurate annotation of a specific disease and do not forget to **remove unannotated drugs** in blank annotation file.
