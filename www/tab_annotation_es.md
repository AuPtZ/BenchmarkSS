### Welcome to Annotation module (for ES) ! 
Manual drug annotation is sometimes a time-consuming job. In this module, We provide a curated preliminary drug annotation from the [**Drug Repurposing Hub**](https://repo-hub.broadinstitute.org/repurposing).    
It includes **Indication** for **163 FDA-approved drugs** across **15 types of cancer**, with over five drugs annotated for each cancer type.
The **download button** enable user to obtain **a annotation file in the format which is compatible in the Benchmark module (for ES)**.   
If you want to get annotation file for AUC, please select **Annotation-For AUC** tab.
