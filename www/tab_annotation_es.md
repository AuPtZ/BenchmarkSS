### Welcome to Annotation module (for ES) ! 
Manual drug annotation is sometimes a time-consuming job. In this module, We provide a curated primary drug annotation from the [**Drug Repurposing Hub**](https://repo-hub.broadinstitute.org/repurposing).    
It includes **Indication** for **163 drugs** interacting with **15 cancers**, where more than five drugs were annotated within one cancer.
The **download button** enable user to obtain **a annotation file in the format which is compatible in the Benchmark module (for ES)**.   
If you want to get annotation file for AUC, please select **Annotation-For AUC** tab.
