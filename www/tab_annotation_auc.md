### Welcome to Annotation module (for AUC) ! 
Manual drug annotation is sometimes a time-consuming job. In this module, We provide a curated primary drug annotation from the efficacy data of anti-cancer drugs within the [**Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database**](https://www.cancerrxgene.org/).  
It includes **IC50 values** for **286 drugs** interacting with **30 cancer cell lines**.  
In instances where multiple drug-cancer pairings are present, we have opted for the smallest IC50 value.  
We categorize **an IC50 value of less than 10μM as 'effective', and conversely, as 'ineffective'**.   
We categorize IC50 values of **less than 10μM as 'effective'**, and those **above as 'ineffective'**.
The **download button** enable user to obtain **a annotation file in the format which is compatible in the Benchmark module (for AUC)**.   
If you want to get annotation file for ES, please select **Annotation-For ES** tab.
